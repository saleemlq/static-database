  "Surah No.": 1,
  "Summary": "This is the first Surah of the Holy Qur’an, but the fifth in the order of revelation.\n\nIt is called Surah Al-Fatiha because the Qur’an begins with it. Its great importance can be understood from the fact that reciting Surah Al-Fatiha is mandatory (Fardh) in the first two rak‘ahs of prayer and required (Wajib) in all remaining rak‘ahs.\n\nSurah Al-Fatiha consists of seven verses, and in a Hadith Qudsi, it is referred to as “ولصۃ”. Allah Almighty says:\n\n“I have divided the prayer between Myself and My servant.\nWhen the servant says ‘All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the Worlds,’ Allah proclaims: ‘My servant has praised Me.’\nWhen the servant says ‘The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful,’ Allah says: ‘My servant has glorified Me.’\nWhen the servant says ‘Master of the Day of Judgment,’ Allah says: ‘My servant has exalted My majesty and entrusted his affairs to Me.’\nWhen the servant says ‘You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help,’ Allah declares: ‘This is between Me and My servant, and My servant shall have what he asks for.’\nAnd when the servant recites from ‘Guide us to the Straight Path’ to ‘not of those who go astray,’ Allah says: ‘This is for My servant, and My servant shall be granted whatever he asks.’ (Sahih Muslim: 877)\n\nSurah Al-Fatiha is also often recited to send rewards to the deceased, which is another reason it is called Surah Al-Fatiha (The Opening).\n\nOther Names of Surah Al-Fatiha:\nSurah Al-Du‘a (The Supplication),\nSurah Al-Mas’alah (The Request),\nSurah Al-Shifa (The Cure),\nSurah Al-Kanz (The Treasure),\nSurah Al-Waqiyah (The Protection),\nSurah Al-Kafiyyah (The Sufficiency),\nSurah Al-Ruqiyyah (The Healing), and\nSurah Al-Hamd (The Praise).\n\nIt contains the essence of praise and glorification of Allah Almighty. It teaches that all worship is for Allah alone, and that He is the only true Helper and Sustainer.\n\nIt also outlines the etiquette of making du‘a (supplication) to Allah Almighty. Within this Surah, the believer seeks true guidance (Hidayah) — a comprehensive concept that includes the purpose of prophethood, the teachings of the Messengers, and the core message of all divine revelations.\n\nFor this reason, Surah Al-Fatiha is often referred to as the summary of the entire Qur’an."
